\f0\fs24 \cf0 K-Means Mattermost Questions:\
1) It gets really close, I haven\'92t quite seen a perfect run yet, however it almost always groups together the major clusters but sometimes 4s are split between their own category and a bunch in the 5s or the same with 2s and 3s. \
2) I see variations as mentioned above. It will definitely have a well-defined cluster for each group but from time to time you\'92ll see a bunch of one group mixed into another one. 7 almost always improves this, but it does split a group into two which is bad just in the other way. 5 makes it a lot worse, for example it could blend 3s into 3 different groups but everyone else gets their distinct star number.\
